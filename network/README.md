## TODOS
- [ ] Only consider those sg occurrences larger than the following threshold value:
    - [x] sg occurrences larger than 100 (41 classes)
    - [x] sg occurrences larger than 90 (42 classes)
    - [ ] sg occurrences larger than 80
    - [ ] sg occurrences larger than 50
- [ ] Tune the parameters:
    - [ ] # of hidden layers, # of nodes in each hidden layer
    - [ ] activation functions
    - [ ] optimizer and criterion
    - [ ] learning rate
- [ ] Try different types of input data:
    - [x] bands around fermi level after degeneracy translation
    - [x] different # of bands around fermi level
         - [x] 30 bands
         - [x] 40 bands
         - [x] 50 bands
    - [ ] more hs points?
- [ ] Check if lager num_sites cases affect the prediction result
- [x] Try more epochs, see why it doesn't converge

More to come...
