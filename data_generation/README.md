# The data_generation repo is for downloading new data

## The original data are not good enough:
  1. The weights of space group are not uniformly distributed, check [here](../format_data/diagnosis/spacegroup_weights.txt)
  2. Need more data
  3. Contains too much unused info(e.g. lattice vectors ...), lack of some useful info(e.g. space group label and its number)

## Thus, download_data.py is set to download new set of data in new format
